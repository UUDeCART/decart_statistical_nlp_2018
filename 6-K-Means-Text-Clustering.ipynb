    "#### We will use K-means clustering to search for symantic patterns within our corpus.  K-means is a vector quantization method that attemps to partition $N$ observations (our clinical documents) into $K$ clusters. It assigns an observation to a cluster by trying to allign the observations with the cluster centroid. The cluster centroid represents the center of the cluster. K-means tries to minimize the within-cluster-variance which is a measure of compactness. So the idea is to generate as compact clusters as possible given a set of observations to assign.  \n",

    "## Cluster Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We have a bit of a problem in that we can only conceptualize what high-dimensional space must look like. We are only able to visualize 3-dimensional space and most of us prefer 2-dimensional visualization. With text clustering we are dealing with 100's of dimensions, one for each vector term we used. Well the good news is that we have figured out how to perform reduction mappiing which projects high-dimensional space onto lower 2-dimensional space for visualizetion. We will use a process known as multidemensional scaling that attemps to preserve the distance between objects when reduced to low dimensional space. This may take a little time so be patient, eventually you will see the clusters in 2-dimensional space.    "
